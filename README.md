# nvim-config
I use this repository to version control my Nvim configuration file. As this configuration is intended to Nvim, I don't have to set a lot of options.


# Installation
## Windows
The init.vim file should go inside the directory located at: ~/AppData/Local/nvim. If the directory does not exist, create it and put the init.vim file inside.

## Linux
The init.vim file should go inside the directory located at: ~/.config/nvim.

## Plugins
After you put the configuration file in the right place, you can install the plugins. Since the plugin manager I use is [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug), you'll need to run the Ex command **:PlugInstall** or change the file such that it suits your preffered plugin manager.
